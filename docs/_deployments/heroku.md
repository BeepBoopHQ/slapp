# Deploying to Heroku

<div class="section-content">
This guide will walk you through preparing and deploying a Slack app using [Bolt for JavaScript](/bolt-js) to the [Heroku platform](https://heroku.com/). Along the way, weâ€™ll download a Bolt Slack app, prepare it for Heroku, and deploy it online.
</div>

---

### Get a Bolt Slack app

Let's get started! We're going to use the app that you created in the [Getting Started with Bolt for JavaScript](/bolt-js/tutorials/getting_started) guide. It's a regular Bolt Slack app that we use to learn how to prepare and deploy an app to Heroku.

Get a fresh copy of the Getting Started app:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js-getting-started-app.git
cd bolt-js-getting-started-app/
```

> ðŸ’¡ You can also follow along with an existing Bolt app but there may be a few extra steps to do.

Perfect! Now that we have the app, let's move onto preparing it for Heroku.

---

### Prepare the app for Heroku

Heroku is a flexible platform that uses a few conventions to understand how to host your app. In this section, we'll update your app to be compatible with Heroku.

**1. Add a Procfile**

Every Heroku app uses a special file called `Procfile` that tells Heroku how to start your app. You can now create a new file called `Procfile` (without any extension) and add the following code:

```yaml
web: node app.js
```

<!-- Add Git init instructions -->

**2. A few extra steps for existing apps**

Are you following this guide with an existing app that you created? If so, please read about [preparing a codebase for Heroku guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/preparing-a-codebase-for-heroku-deployment#4-listen-on-the-correct-port). The guide will help you setup a Git repository, listen on the correct port, and think about provisioning data storage.

We're done preparing your app for Heroku! Now we can setup the Heroku tools on your local machine.

---

### Setup the Heroku tools

Now we can set up the Heroku tools on your local machine. The tools will help you manage, deploy, and debug your app on the Heroku platform.

**1. Install the Heroku CLI**

The Heroku tools are available as a Command Line Interface (CLI). Go ahead and [install the Heroku CLI for macOS, Windows, or Linux](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up). On macOS, you can run the command:

```shell
brew install heroku/brew/heroku
```

Once the install is complete, we can test the Heroku CLI by displaying the available commands:

```shell
heroku help
```

> ðŸ’¡ If the `heroku` command is not found, you can update your path by opening a new terminal session/tab.

**2. Log into the Heroku CLI**

The Heroku CLI connects your local machine with your Heroku account so that you can create and manage apps. You can now [sign up for a free Heroku account](https://heroku.com) and then log into the Heroku CLI with the command:

```shell
heroku login
```
> ðŸ’¡ If you're behind a firewall, you may need to [set the proxy environment variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-the-cli#using-an-http-proxy) for the Heroku CLI.

**3. Confirm you're logged into the Heroku CLI**

Lastly, let's double-check that you're logged in by displaying the account that's currently connected to your Heroku CLI:

```shell
heroku auth:whoami
# Output: <your Heroku account>
```

You're all setup with the Heroku tools! Now let's move onto the exciting step of creating a instance in the Heroku cloud.

---

### Create an app on Heroku

Now we can create an app on the Heroku platform. An app can be created and managed in a couple of ways, including the [Heroku App Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) or [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps). In this guide, we'll create an app using the Heroku CLI.

You can create an app using the Heroku CLI with the command:

```shell
heroku create my-bolt-app-name
# or, just 'heroku create' to use a random name
```

> ðŸ’¡ You can [rename your Heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/renaming-apps) at any time, but you may need to update your Git remotes and app URLs.

When the app creation is complete, the Heroku CLI will magically add a Git remote called `heroku` that's associated with your Heroku app's remote repository.

We'll learn more about the Git remote when we deploy your app, but you can view your local Git remotes with the command:

```shell
git remote
# main (or master)
# heroku
```

Now that we have prepared your local app and created a Heroku app, the next step is to deploy it online!

---

### Deploy the app

To deploy the app, we're going to push your app to a Heroku web server, update your Slack app's settings and then say "hello" to your brand new Heroku app. âœ¨

**1. Deploy to a Heroku web server**

When deploying an app to Heroku, you'll typically use the `git push` command. This will push your code from your local repository to your `heroku` remote repository.

You can now deploy your app with the command:

```shell
git push heroku main
```

> ðŸ’¡ Heroku deploys code that's pushed to the [master or main branches](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git-branches). Pushing to other branches does nothing.

Now that your code is deployed, we need to start a web server instance using the command:

```shell
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

**2. Update your Slack app's setting**

Back in the [Getting Started guide][getting-started-guide], you used ngrok to receive HTTP requests for events and interactivity. Now that your app is on Heroku, we need to update the **Request URLs** to be your Heroku app's web address.

You can update the **Request URL** with the following steps:

1. Browse to your [Slack Apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps)
1. Select your app
1. Select **Interactivity & Shortcuts** from the side bar
  - Update the **Request URL** to xxx
1. Select **Event Subscriptions** from the side bar
  - Update the **Request URL** to xxx

**3. Test your Slack app**

It's time test your Slack app by saying "hello" (lower-case) in a channel that your app has joined. Just like in the [Getting Started guide](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started#sending-and-responding-to-actions), your app should respond.

---

### Deploying an update

As you build your Slack app, you'll want to continue deploying updates to Heroku. The common steps are to make a change, commit it to Git, and then push it to Heroku.

Let's update your your app to respond to "goodbye" by adding the following code to `app.js` ([source code on GitHub](https://github.com)):

```javascript
// Listens to incoming messages that contain "goodbye"
app.message('goodbye', async ({ message, say }) => {
  // say() sends a message to the channel where the event was triggered
  await say(`See ya later, <@${message.user}> :wave:`);
});
```

Commit the changes to your local Git respository:

```shell
git commit -am "Say 'goodbye' to a person"
```

Deploy the update by pushing to your `heroku` remote:

```shell
git push heroku main
```

When the deploy is complete, you can open a Slack channel that your app has joined and say "goodbye" (lower-case). You should see a friendly goodbye from your Slack app:

> See ya later, Michael ðŸ‘‹
